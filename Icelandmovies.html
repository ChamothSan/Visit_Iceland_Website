            <h1>The Hollywood Sights of Iceland</h1>
            <p class="batman">Batman and James Bond have at least one thing in common: Both have been filmed at the foot of Svínafellsjökull Glacier.</p>
            <p>Another fun fact: The “Arrowhead Mountain” from Game of Thrones is locally known as Kirkjufell.</p>
            <p>Iceland has in the past decade emerged as a major (filming) location for Hollywood, a development which has been somewhat aided by the Icelandic Government's handsome reimbursement scheme for film productions to lure major movie studios to the country.</p>

            <h1>Thank you, Walter Mitty!</h1>
            <p>Ben Stiller, the director of the 2013 blockbuster <b>“The Secret Life of Walter Mitty”</b>, was among the first to discover Iceland has an all-around location. Scenes set to be in Afghanistan were filmed on the desolated Breiðamerkursandur and the film even uses the Vatnajökull Glacier to represent Greenland’s ice cap.</p>
            <p>The scene in which the titular character, Walter Mitty, skateboards on a winding road into a valley is shot in Seyðisfjörður in East Iceland. Later in the film, Walter visits a large waterfall in Nepal filmed at Skógafoss, an easily accessible waterfall in South Iceland.</p>
            <p>Few films travel the length of Walter Mitty, but the film showed Hollywood the extent of possibilities in Iceland. Director Christopher Nolan, who filmed both <b>“Batman Begins”</b> (2005) and <b>“Interstellar”</b> (2014) in southern Iceland, says Iceland is “one of the few places in the world where you can get two or three very different, extreme looks, within the space of a couple of miles.”</p>

            <h1>Ennis, Alaska is not a real place</h1>
            <p>Iceland's landscape is not the only attraction. The government-funded <a href="https://filminiceland.com/">Film in Iceland</a> lures big projects with a 35% refund on production costs regardless of topic: a small town in Iceland might as well represent a cold place somewhere. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective_(season_4)">True Detective</a>, Season 4, is set in the state of Alaska, high above the Arctic Circle, in a town named Ennis. In reality, Ennis does not exist.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.visiticeland.com/article/a-day-in-dalvik">Dalvík</a>, the northern seaside community known for whale watching, was turned into the fictional Alaskan settlement where Jody Foster and Kali Reis play Detectives Liz and Evangeline. In southern Iceland, scenes were film at <a href="https://rvkstudios.is/">RVK Studios</a>, the 'film village' on Reykjavík's outskirts.</p>

            <h1>Famous attractions</h1>
            <p>Due to the budget benefits of being close to the capital, most film locations are in southern Iceland, where the Vatnajökull National Park ranks number one.</p>
            <p>The Svínafellsjökull Glacier, just off Route 1 via a bumpy gravel road, first emerged as the “Hollywood” glacier ” after the opening scene of the James Bond film <b>“Die Another Day”</b>. The ice has since retreated and, while still impressive, the last documented production was for the second season of “Game of Thrones”.</p>           
            <p><b>“Game of Thrones”</b> is, roughly speaking, ten percent Iceland. Iconic sights such as Dimmuborgir and Skógafoss serve as backdrops to the fictional world of fire and ice. After the picturesque Kirkjufell mountain was first featured on the show visitor numbers soared to the once-pristine place. It is now dubbed the most photographed mountain in Iceland.</p>

            <h2 style="text-transform: uppercase;">This village is on Netflix</h2>
            <p>The success of Icelandic TV series, especially on Netflix, have casted remote towns and villages into the spotlight. The Siglufjörður-based crime drama <b>“Trapped”</b> boosted the tourist economy for the beautiful northern town and the 2021 dystopia <b>“Katla”</b> highlighted the proximity of Vík to Iceland’s most notorious volcano.</p>
